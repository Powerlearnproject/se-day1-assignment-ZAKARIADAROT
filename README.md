#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. (question)
  Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to software development. It involves designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems to 
  ensure they are efficient, reliable, and scalable.
  it importance are:
    1.Ensures Quality & Reliability – Helps create software that is error-free and efficient.
    2. Manages Complexity – Helps in structuring large-scale software projects.
    3. Cost Efficiency – Reduces development costs through efficient planning and design.
    4. Improves Security – Ensures robust security practices are followed.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering. (question)
 1. NATO Software Engineering Conference:

Marked the birth of software engineering as a formal discipline to address the software crisis (projects being late, costly, and full of bugs).
2 .Introduction of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

OOP (Java, C++, Python) introduced concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making code more reusable and maintainable.
3. The Agile Manifesto:

Introduced Agile development, emphasizing iterative development, flexibility, and customer collaboration, replacing traditional Waterfall methods.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. (question)
1 Planning – Define project scope and objectives.
2 Requirements Analysis – Gather and document what the software should do.
3 Design – Create system architecture and UI design.
4 Implementation (Coding) – Write the actual code.
5 Testing – Identify and fix bugs.
6 Deployment – Release the software for users.
7 Maintenance & Support – Fix issues and update the software over time.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate. (question)
Approach:
Waterfall: A sequential and structured approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.
Agile: An iterative and flexible approach where development is done in repeated cycles (sprints).

Phases:
Waterfall: Each phase is completed before moving forward, meaning there is no going back to previous stages.
Agile: Development occurs in small, incremental cycles, allowing for continuous feedback and improvements.

Flexibility:
Waterfall: Rigid and difficult to modify once the development process has started.
Agile: Highly adaptable to changing requirements, making it more suitable for evolving projects.

Examples:
Waterfall: Used in government projects, aircraft control systems, and banking software, where strict guidelines must be followed.
Agile: Common in mobile app development, startups, and AI-driven applications, where flexibility is needed.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team. (question)
Software Developer:
Writes, tests, and maintains code.
Translates requirements into functional applications.

Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer:
Designs and executes test cases.
Ensures the software is bug-free before release.

Project Manager (PM):
Plans and tracks progress.
Manages the development team and ensures deadlines are met.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each. (question)
 Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):
Provide tools for coding, debugging, and testing in one place.
Examples: Visual Studio Code.

Version Control Systems (VCS):
Track and manage code changes, allowing collaboration.
Examples: Git (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges. (question)
 Code complexity 
 Solution: Follow coding standards and documentation.
 Debugging and testing  
 Solution: Implement automated testing.
 Challenge: Project deadlines 
 Solution: Use Agile and proper planning.
 Challenge: Security vulnerabilities  
 Solution: Regular security audits and coding best practices.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance. (question)
 Unit Testing – Tests individual components of a system.
 Integration Testing – Ensures different modules work together.
 System Testing – Tests the entire application as a whole.
 Acceptance Testing – Confirms that the software meets business requirements before release.

Importance: Ensures the software is error-free, functional, and secure before deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models. (question)
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing clear and specific inputs (prompts) to get the most accurate and useful responses from AI models like ChatGPT.

Helps AI understand requests better.
Improves the accuracy and relevance of responses.
Used in AI-powered tools, chatbots, automation, and content generation.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective. (question)
"Tell me about Python."

Improved Prompt:
"Explain Python programming, its main features, and how it's used in data science and web development."

Why is the improved prompt better?

More specific (focuses on Python’s features and use cases).
Clearer expectations (AI knows what to focus on).
Leads to a more useful and detailed response.
